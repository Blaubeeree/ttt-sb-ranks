#TTT Scoreboard Ranks for ULX

##What does this do?
It's an easier way of adding custom ranks to the scoreboard in TTT.  
It allows you to change what it says at the top, set one rank and color for a group or make the text show rainbow colors.  
TTT Scoreboard Ranks will often be abbreviated as "TTT SB Ranks".

##Current features:
- Allows you to add, change existing, remove ranks and customize color.
- Allows you to add or change an existing rank to use "rainbow" colors. This will gradually change colors.
- Notifies admins (or groups that inherit from 'admin') about outdated versions.
- Changing the default rank.
- Changing column width.
- Changing column name.
- Support for setting group ranks.

##Planned features:
- None as of yet (Suggestions?).

##Current permissions:
- Admins:
    - Adding, changing and removing ranks (colors + rainbows).
- Superadmins:
    - Changing the default rank, column width and column name.
    - Adding, changing (via addgrouprank) and removing group ranks (colors + rainbows).

##Notes:
- Custom, per-user ranks will override group ranks.

##Requirements:
- [ULX & ULib](http://ulyssesmod.net/)
